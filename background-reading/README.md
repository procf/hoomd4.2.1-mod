# Background Reading

For a quick (but comprehensive) overview of our simulation methods, see the PDF background guides:
1. [Intro to DPD](/Background-Reading/1-DPD-8pg.pdf)
2. [Modifying DPD for colloids simulations](/Background-Reading/2-DPD-for-Colloids-18pg.pdf)
3. [Morse Potential](/Background-Reading/3-Morse-Potential-2pg.pdf)
4. [Applying shear to colloid simualtion](/Background-Reading/4-Shearing-4pg.pdf)
