## Scripts

This folder contains example scripts for simulations in the PRO-CF Colloids Team.

1. [install-update](/scripts/install-update): bash scripts for installing and updating hoomd4.1-mod
2. [sim-templates](/scripts/sim-templates): template scripts for monodisperse colloidal simulations using [Brownian Dynamics](/scripts/sim-templates/Brownian-sims) or [Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)](/scripts/sim-templates/DPD-sims). Options exist for initializing with a fixed simulation box size OR a fixed number of colloids. Initialization, equilibrium, and gelation scripts are provided for all methods. Shearing scripts are currently only available for DPD sims. Basic analysis scripts (extracting data from a GSD file, plotting temperature and shear, correcting values from a shearing sim) are also included.
3. [sim-analysis](/scripts/sim-analysis): examples of other common simulation analyses (Fortran and Python).
